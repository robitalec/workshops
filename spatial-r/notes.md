## NEW *********
Plotting rasters on top of vectors
Projections

https://github.com/plotly/rasterly

what else


plotting rasters: rasterVis::gplot



## Working with spatial data
* buffers, bbox, spatial operations
* converting from data.table to sf
	+ providing crs properly according to new gdal/proj
* projections
* really quick subsetting sf objects


## Exploring data, making maps
* mapview
* mapview with data.tables
* with sf objects
* why isnt the basemap coming up (crs)
* mapview(raster)
* basic cartography
* basic plotting vect, rast


Questions:
* where can we get basic landscape maps (e.g for study sites, etc...) ?
* re: where can I get data - I assume that the NL folks probably are all using the same publically available data, but still interested in online sources
* plotting spatial data
* advantages of different kinds of spatial data, what is a GeoJSON?
* overview of do's and dont's/tips and tricks
