# Why Git

Tracks history
* explicitly save versions of files, without resorting to `my_file_2015-05-20.docx` or `FINAL_final_file_12.R`
* full backup of who changed what when, and (with a *Good* Commit Message [1, 2]) why

Diverse uses
* small projects, big projects, papers, books, websites, software, ...

Broaden collaboration and contributions
* eg. R packages, communities like rOpenSci and The Carpentries, ...

Finally, **Git helps you code...**

As detailed or brief as you'd like - but something along the lines of 
eg. I switch between my browser + my RStudio when I'm trying to solve a 
problem, and I keep hammering away until I get it. When I do, I save the script
and take a break. 

Where can we fit Git in?

We might say - every 5 minutes, or every 30 minutes, open up Git and 
see what you've changed. Are these useful changes? Did any of these work, 
or do they represent useful steps along the way? Commit!

An alternative is, right after you finally save your script after the solution, 
make a commit. Quicker, simpler, but with less feedback.
