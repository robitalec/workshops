# What is Google Earth Engine?

- A processing platform that allows you to run algorithms on georeferenced imagery and vectors on Google's super computers  

- Essentially, it is the easiest way to deal with remote sensing data

- Contains a **massive** public data catalogue of documentation, scripts, functions, and imagery

- Earth Engine has an interactive interface called the 'Code Editor', which runs largely on Java or Python 

- The code editor allows you to find relevant imagery, process it, share your code, and save your code and processed imagery to your Google Drive

# Data Types

## Image 
- All raster data is represented as an `Image` object in Earth Engine
- The `ee.Image` function is the main function to load in `Images` in the Code Editor
- E.g. a single Landsat photo

--

## Image Collection
- A stack or sequence of `Images`
- Can be found in the Earth Engine data catalog
- E.g. **All** the Landsat 7 imagery 


---

# Data Types Continued

## Feature
- A `Feature` in Earth Engine is an object with a geometry (vector)
- Polygon, line, point
- `Features` can be created in Earth Engine or uploaded
- E.g. a study area polygon

--

## Feature Collection
- Groups of related `Features`
- Do not need to have the same geometries or properties to be in a Feature Collection
- E.g. Relocation points for all animals in a study

# Sources of Data 

1. Climate & Weather
  - Surface temps
  - Atmosphere
  - Weather & Climate
  - etc.  
  
2. Imagery
  - Landsat (NDVI, NDMI, EVI, etc.)
  - Sentinel (weather, land cover conditions, etc.)
  - MODIS (surface reflectance, snow cover, etc.)
  - Hi. Res. (aerial imagery at 1 m resolution)  
  
3. Geophysical
  - Terrain
  - Land cover 
  - Cropland
  - etc.

# Sources of Data Example 

- Let's try getting some data together




---
# Filtering Data 

- Obviously these data files are far larger than necessary 
- We want to filter the data so it is relevant to us  

--

- We are going to filter the data we found to be within our study area AND our study dates



---
class:review

# Filtering Data Example 

- Let's filter this data! 



---

# Importing Objects 

- You don't need to manually choose a point or polygon within Google Earth Engine when filtering data, you can import your relevant features and use them  

- E.g. Importing relocation points, study grid, study area boundaries, etc.



---
class:review

# Importing Objects Example 
- Let's import our study points and use them to filter our data! 



---
# Processing
- Earth Engine is extremely powerful when it comes to processing power 
- Options are (almost) limitless 
- We can extract the values we are interested in, calculate a mean over our study time, and much more 
- Saves us the trouble of processing these massive images in R 



---
class:review

# Processing Example 

- Let's get the mean NDVI value at each of our study points



---
# Exporting 
- Now we have a processed `Image Collection` and we can export our work 
- Earth Engine exports your work to your Google Drive account 
- **NOTE:** MUN students have unlimited storage in their Google Drive and their email does not expire (as of right now)

# Exporting Example 

- Let's export our processed data to our Google Drive
