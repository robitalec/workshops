# What is Google Earth Engine?

- A processing platform that allows you to run algorithms on georeferenced imagery and vectors on Google's super computers  

- Essentially, it is the easiest way to deal with remote sensing data

- Contains a **massive** public data catalogue of documentation, scripts, functions, and imagery

- Earth Engine has an interactive interface called the 'Code Editor', which runs largely on Java or Python 

- The code editor allows you to find relevant imagery, process it, share your code, and save your code and processed imagery to your Google Drive

# Data Types

## Image 
- All raster data is represented as an Image object in Earth Engine
- The ee.Image function is the main function to load in images in the Code Editor
- E.g. a single Landsat photo

--

## Image Collection
- A stack or sequence of Images
- Can be found in the Earth Engine data catalog
- E.g. **All** the Landsat 7 imagery 


---

# Data Types Continued

## Feature
- A Feature in Earth Engine is an object with a geometry (vector)
- Polygon, line, point
- Features can be created in Earth Engine or uploaded
- E.g. a study area polygon

--

## Feature Collection
- Groups of related Features
- Do not need to have the same geometries or properties to be in a Feature Collection
- E.g. Relocation points for all animals in a study

# Filtering Data 

is this the same as sampling?



---

# Filtering Data Example 

let's do it together



---

# Importing Objects 

bring in things relevant to your study

---

# Sampling 



Reduce it to relevant time/space/etc.
