# What is Earth Engine?

- A processing platform that allows you to run algorithms on georeferenced imagery and vectors on Google's servers 

- Contains a **massive** catalog of geospatial data 

- Accessible through the online Code Editor, and a Javascript and Python libraries

The code editor allows you to find relevant imagery, process it, share your code, and save your code and processed imagery to your Google Drive

# Data types

## Image
- `ee.Image`
- An image composed of one or many bands
- Properties: name, data type, scale, mask and projection
- E.g.: a single Landsat scene, a single land cover raster

```{js}
var l7scene = ee.Image('LANDSAT/LE07/C01/T1_RT/LE07_001004_20000610');
```

--

## Image Collection
- `ee.Image.Collection`
- A stack or sequence of images
- E.g. *All* the Landsat 7 imagery 
]

```{js}
var l7 = ee.ImageCollection('LANDSAT/LE07/C01/T1_RT');
```

???
Differences between R and EE:

Image in EE = `ee.Image`
Image in R = mainly `raster`

---
# Data types

## Feature
- `ee.Feature`
- A feature composed of a Geometry object and properties
- `Features` can be created in Earth Engine or uploaded
- E.g. points, lines and polygons, a study area polygon


```{js}
// Create an ee.Geometry.
var polygon = ee.Geometry.Polygon([
  [[-35, -10], [35, -10], [35, 10], [-35, 10], [-35, -10]]
]);

// Create a Feature from the Geometry.
var polyFeature = ee.Feature(polygon, {foo: 42, bar: 'tart'});
```

---

# Data types

## Feature Collection
- `ee.FeatureCollection`
- Groups of related `Features`
- Do not need to have the same geometries or properties to be in a Feature Collection
- E.g. Relocation points for all animals in a study

```{js}
var fc = ee.FeatureCollection('TIGER/2016/Roads');
```

???
Properties = dictionary


Differences between R and EE:

`ee.Feature` ~~ `sf::st_geometry()`
`ee.FeatureCollection` ~~ `sf`, `sfc`

### String

```{js}
// Use single (or double) quotes 
//  to make a string.
var potato = 'yukon gold';
// Use parentheses to pass 
//  arguments to functions.
print(potato);
```

### Numbers
```{js}
// Store a number in a variable.
var number = 17;
print(number);
```

]

### Dictionary

```{js}
// Use curly brackets {} to make a 
//  dictionary of key:value pairs.
var object = {
  foo: 'bar',
  baz: 13,
  stuff: ['kilo', 'lima', 'mike']
};

print('Print stuff:', object['stuff']);
```

### List

```{js}
// Use square brackets [] to 
//  make a list.
var listOfNumbers = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5];
```

# Sources of data


1. Imagery
  - Landsat
  - Sentinel 
  - MODIS 
  - Derived imagery (e.g. NDVI)
  
2. Geophysical
  - Elevation, terrain
  - Land cover
  - Cropland


3. Climate
  - Surface temperature
  - Atmosphere
  - Weather

# Example - sources of data 

## Image
- Script: [Examples/Image/From Name](https://code.earthengine.google.com/856e0c5d65858be858aabada28a5d5da)

## Image Collection
- Script: [Exploring image collections](https://code.earthengine.google.com/1a5ee71d43b85ac287afe0285126f804)
- Use the Search bar to see all the Image Collections that are available
- Use the asset id to load the image collection and add them to the map

# Filtering data

- Unlike R, Earth Engine optimizes the *final* call using deferred execution. In short, this means that operations like "clip" are usually unnecessary. 

- Instead, we filter our data:
   - spatial filter e.g. within bounds
   - temporal filter e.g. within dates
   - attribute filter e.g. type equals "cheese"



```{js}
var point = ee.Geometry.Point(-122.262, 37.8719);

var start = ee.Date('2014-06-01');
var finish = ee.Date('2014-10-01');

var filteredCollection = ee.ImageCollection('LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1')
  .filterBounds(point)
  .filterDate(start, finish);
```

# Importing features 

Either a Shapefile (and related `.dbf`, `.shx` and `.prj` files) or a zip file of these, or a CSV

In R, take an example sf object and zip it

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(sf)
dir.create('example-features')

df <- data.frame(id = LETTERS[1:3],
                 lon = c(-137.03, -136.94, -137.10),
                 lat = c(60.46, 60.50, 60.52))
points <- st_as_sf(df, coords = c('lon', 'lat'))

st_write(points, 'example-features/ex-abc.shp')

zip('example-abc.zip', 'example-features')
```

Upload the asset, then load the asset in your Earth Engine scripts

```{js}
var features = ee.FeatureCollection('users/robit.a/example-abc');
```

???
- You don't need to manually choose a point or polygon within Google Earth Engine when filtering data, you can import your relevant features and use them  

- E.g. Importing relocation points, study grid, study area boundaries, etc.

# Exporting


???

Earth Engine exports your work to your Google Drive account (or to an asset or to a Cloud Storage account)


Note: MUN students have unlimited storage in their Google Drive and their email does not expire (as of right now)
