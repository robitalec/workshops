# What is Google Earth Engine?

- A processing platform that allows you to run algorithms on georeferenced imagery and vectors on Google's super computers  

- Contains a **massive** catalog of geospatial data 

- Accessible through the online Code Editor, and a Javascript and Python libraries

The code editor allows you to find relevant imagery, process it, share your code, and save your code and processed imagery to your Google Drive

# Data Types

## Image
- `ee.Image`
- An image composed of one or many bands
- Properties: name, data type, scale, mask and projection
- E.g.: a single Landsat scene, a single land cover raster

```{js}
var l7scene = ee.Image('LANDSAT/LE07/C01/T1_RT/LE07_001004_20000610');
```

--

## Image Collection
- `ee.Image.Collection`
- A stack or sequence of images
- E.g. *All* the Landsat 7 imagery 
]

```{js}
var l7 = ee.ImageCollection('LANDSAT/LE07/C01/T1_RT');
```

???
Differences between R and EE:

Image in EE = `ee.Image`
Image in R = mainly `raster`

---
# Data Types

## Feature
- `ee.Feature`
- A feature composed of a Geometry object and properties
- `Features` can be created in Earth Engine or uploaded
- E.g. points, lines and polygons, a study area polygon


```{js}
// Create an ee.Geometry.
var polygon = ee.Geometry.Polygon([
  [[-35, -10], [35, -10], [35, 10], [-35, 10], [-35, -10]]
]);

// Create a Feature from the Geometry.
var polyFeature = ee.Feature(polygon, {foo: 42, bar: 'tart'});
```

---

# Data Types

## Feature Collection
- `ee.FeatureCollection`
- Groups of related `Features`
- Do not need to have the same geometries or properties to be in a Feature Collection
- E.g. Relocation points for all animals in a study

```{js}
var fc = ee.FeatureCollection('TIGER/2016/Roads');
```

???
Properties = dictionary


Differences between R and EE:

`ee.Feature` ~~ `sf::st_geometry()`
`ee.FeatureCollection` ~~ `sf`, `sfc`

# Sources of Data 

1. Climate & Weather
  - Surface temps
  - Atmosphere
  - Weather & Climate
  - etc.  
  
2. Imagery
  - Landsat (NDVI, NDMI, EVI, etc.)
  - Sentinel (weather, land cover conditions, etc.)
  - MODIS (surface reflectance, snow cover, etc.)
  - Hi. Res. (aerial imagery at 1 m resolution)  
  
3. Geophysical
  - Terrain
  - Land cover 
  - Cropland
  - etc.

# Sources of Data Example 

- Let's try getting some data together
- Use the Search bar in Earth Engine to see all the Images/Image Collections that are available to you

# Filtering Data 

- Obviously these data files are far larger than necessary  

- We want to filter the data so it is relevant to us  

- We are going to filter the data we found to be within our study area AND our study dates



---
class:review

# Filtering Data Example 

- Let's filter this data! 



---

# Importing Objects 

- You don't need to manually choose a point or polygon within Google Earth Engine when filtering data, you can import your relevant features and use them  

- E.g. Importing relocation points, study grid, study area boundaries, etc.



---
class:review

# Importing Objects Example 
- Let's import our study points and use them to filter our data!

Band math

sampling


# Processing
- Earth Engine is extremely powerful when it comes to processing power 
- Options are (almost) limitless 
- We can extract the values we are interested in, calculate a mean over our study time, and much more 
- Saves us the trouble of processing these massive images in R 



---
class:review

# Processing Example 

- Let's get the mean NDVI value at each of our study points



---
# Exporting 
- Now we have a processed `Image Collection` and we can export our work 
- Earth Engine exports your work to your Google Drive account 
- **NOTE:** MUN students have unlimited storage in their Google Drive and their email does not expire (as of right now)

# Exporting Example
