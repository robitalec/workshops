# Results

With a random example dataset, we can produce a random example figure. 

(ref:clarity) The relationship between clarity and carat. Who knows anything about diamonds?

(ref:color) The relationship between color and carat, colored by carat. Huh, look at that, I'm representing the same information in two different ways. Feels like that's an unnecessary (though aesthetically pleasant) thing to do.
