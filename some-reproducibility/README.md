# Some Reproducibility

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Workshop focusing on some parts of reproducible research, namely capturing the computational environment
and automating workflows.

Focusing on two packages:

* [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv)
* [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/)



### Example project

Starting with a completed example, we'll look at how `renv` help us track packages (and versions) used for a 
project and how `drake` helps us explictly define and track our workflow. 



### Exercise

1. Open the [Binder]() link here: TODO.
1. Make a new RStudio project. 
1. Setup renv.
1. Setup drake. 
1. Write three functions to process TODO input process1 process2 output TODO
1. Make a figure. Wrap it as a function.
1. Make a plan. 
1. Vis, edit, vis. 93 till infinity. 
1. Zip up your results: `zip::zip('a.zip', 'a')`
